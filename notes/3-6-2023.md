The thing that I need to mark for tracking `call`s are the `AbiHints` generated by the Vex lifter.

Any time that they appear, they are either replacing a `call` or a `ret` instruction. Now I just need a way to:

1. Differeniate between the two
2. Figure out what specifically the `call` is pointing to. If it is pointing to libc stuff, I'll need to add it to my list of program commands.
